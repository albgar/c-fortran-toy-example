Toy example for C-Fortran interoperability with opaque types

In this example there are no wrappers, at the expense of having to call the
c_loc function in the fortran program (t.f90).

Note the subtlety regarding the initial allocation of the derived type.

To compile, use:

make chh
make fhh

for the C and Fortran sides, respectively.

The results should be:

./chh
     1

./fhh
     1
