Toy example for C-Fortran interoperability with opaque types

Updated version with actual wrappers.
The Fortran version is cleaner, and the C one transparently
supports the allocatable array without having to deal with it.

To compile, use:

make chh
make fhh

for the C and Fortran sides, respectively.

Forthcoming: Example with "matrix" module.
